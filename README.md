( Coursera Capstone: This repository is a part of Coursera Final Capstone Project)

## 1	Introduction
The battel of neighborhood is an important data science project targeting the clusters of similar types to provide a user to exploit this as a tool for an ample number of business choices. This project is based on the application of different data science techniques learned in the entire course. 
### 1.1	Objective
With the given set of objectives, the battle of neighborhoods has been implemented for exploration of data using Segmenting and Clustering techniques applied to the neighborhoods in Toronto.  The objective of Applied Data Science Capstone is given as follows:
1.	To learn about clustering and k-means clustering in particular.
2.	To showcase this project in the form the public repository using github platform.
3.	To learn how to use the Foursquare API and clustering to segment and cluster the neighborhoods in New York City.
4.	To learn how to use the Beautifulsoup Python package to scrape websites and parse HTML code.
5.	To apply the skills acquired so far in this course to segment and cluster neighborhoods in the city of Toronto.

Aiming to above objectives the data has been collected from following Wikipedia page, ```https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M . ```

__For this purpose knowledge of Python, Data Science, Visualization, Machine Learning Algorithms, Segmentation, HTML parsing, Repository site GitHub, and Foursquare is required. How do I utilize the complete program to build the “The Battle of Neighborhoods” project have been shown in the background section.__

## 2  Background
__The battel of the neighborhood was started from day one of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate course designed uniquely to become a data scientist (Santarcangelo, Ahuja, et al. 2018). The introduction of each of the faculty members involved in delivering this course has been given in the cited web source as shown in the reference section of this report.  Following a set of courses described how it has been utilized to develop the Capstone Project.__ 

1. The course started with learning “What is Data Science”, which was taught by Alex Aklson and Polong Lin. This module motivated us to lead towards the path of data science (Aklson and Lin, What is Data Science 2018). This module gives insight into the statistics involved in the field of data science, the demand for data scientists, and some of the qualities of excelling data scientists. According to this course, module data science is considered the sexiest job in the 21st century. The term "cloud" was explained by scientists. Different tools, algorithms, and technologies they use daily were elaborated and also motivated by the data science professionals as they advise anyone passionate about data science. 

2. Open Source tools such as Jupyter Notebook, Apache Zeppelin Notebooks, and IBM Data Science Experience and Cognitive Class Labs (IBM Watson) for Data Science were discussed by Polong Lin (Lin 2018). The entire lab practice sessions for all other courses were completed using IBM Watson. 

3. The course Data Science Methodology presented by Alex and Lin explained the characteristics of the modeling process, the Modeling and the Model Evaluation stages of any data science problem. This module helped us to understand data, ways in which data is prepared, the purpose of data modeling, means to evaluate a model and ways in which a model is evaluated, means to prepare or clean data and finally to complete the Data Understanding and the Data Preparation stages about any data science problem (Aklson and Lin, Data Science Methodology 2018).

4. The course Python for Data Science and AI started a practical journey, which was delivered by Joseph Santarcangelo. This module covered Python Basics, first program, Types, Expressions and Variables, String Operations, Python Data Structures such as Lists and Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries.  Programming Fundamentals such as Conditions and Branching, Loops, Functions, and Objects and Classes were discussed.  This course also covered Reading files with open, writing files with open, loading data with Pandas, working with and Saving data with Pandas and Numpy (Santarcangelo, Python for data science 2018). 

5. The Databases and SQL for Data Science course taught by Rav Ahuja, helped us to understand SQL and Relational Databases, to write basic SQL statements, Practice basic SQL statements hands-on on a live database, and to create a database instance on the IBM Watson Cloud (Ahuja 2018). 
6. The course Data Analysis with Python taught by Joseph Santarcangelo, covered data analysis from scratch. This is the biggest and very important course in this program. The PGA also found helpful to develop our concept of Data Analytics with Python (Santarcangelo, Data Analysis with Python 2018). 
7. Data Visualization with Python is the 7th course in this series. Alex Akeson taught in this course about reading CSV files into a pandas data frame and process and manipulate the data in the data frame followed by data visualization and some of the best practices to keep in mind when creating plots and visuals. He has also explained different kinds of plots using Matplotlib (Aklson, Introduction to Data Visualization Tools 2018).

8. Machine Learning with Python is the final derivable of this certification course. The course has taught by Saeed Aghabozorgi. He has demonstrated the Python libraries for Machine Learning. The course covered Supervised vs. Unsupervised algorithms with examples. Simple and Multiple Regression, Linear and Non-Linear Regression have been on a dataset for estimation. Different Classification methods and its application have been shown in various datasets to solve real-world problems. Recommender systems have been discussed, in this connection, we will get introduced with the main idea behind recommendation engines, then two main types of recommendation engines, namely, content-based and collaborative filtering (Aghabozorgi 2018).

9. The GitHub repository is a way to showcase our implemented ideas in front of the world. Github has been set up using steps given in a blog post entitled “How to Properly Setup Your Github Repository — Windows Version” by our faculty Alex Aklson (Aklson 2019). 
All the above topics have been utilized to find a solution to the problem effectively.
